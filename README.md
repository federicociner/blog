My personal website, a static site created with Gatsby and hosted on Netlify. Currently, it contains the following components:

* __About Me__: A short description of who I am and what I do.
* __Blog__: A simple blog in which in post my own random thoughts and experiences. An "anything goes" blog at this point, until I decided to narrow the focus or subject matter.
