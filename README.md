[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/d83e7b9a-4e4d-4dc5-a8ea-a75fc16a1276/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/federicociner/deploys)

My personal website, a static site created with Gatsby and hosted on Netlify. Currently, it contains the following components:

* __About Me__: A short description of who I am and what I do.
* __Blog__: A simple blog in which in post my own random thoughts and experiences. An "anything goes" blog at this point, until I decide to narrow the focus or subject matter.

## Build and Run

To build and run this website locally, you will need to have `npm` and `gatsby-cli` installed on your local development environment. Once you have met these pre-requisites, follow the steps below:

1. Clone this repository locally and `cd` to the root of the project.

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/federicociner/federicociner.com
    cd federicociner.com
    ```

1. To run a local development server, run:

    ```sh
    gatsby develop
    ```

1. To create a production build, run:

    ```sh
    gatsby build
    ```

    All the build files will be available in the `public` folder in the project root directory.
