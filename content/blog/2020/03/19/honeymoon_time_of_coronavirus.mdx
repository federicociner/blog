My wife and I got married about three weeks ago, on the cusp of the COVID-19 pandemic and right after one of the worst summers in Sydney's recorded history. After almost three months of devastating bushfires, followed by a few weeks of torrential rain and flooding, we got married among the vineyards of the Southern Highlands in beautifully mild and sunny weather. To say that we were extremely fortunate that our wedding plans, and the travel plans of more than half of our wedding guests flying in from overseas, were not impacted _any_ of these events is perhaps the understatement of the century.

In any case, everything turned out wonderfully and we had an amazing wedding day with all of our friends from across the world joining us to celebrate. For our honeymoon, we kind of decided last minute (well, I did since I was the one that planned it) that we wanted to go somewhere wild and far, far away from crowds and people in general. So, a multi-day hike in New Zealand's beautiful south island and a couple of days of adventuring in Queenstown ticked all the right boxes.

## The Milford Track

We decided to hike the world-famous Milford Track for the first part of our honeymoon. Since we left bookings until the last minute due to wedding planning craziness and my limitless procrastination, I wasn't able to get any spots for my wife and I in the Department of Conservation (DOC) huts along the track. However, we managed to book the last two spots (for a _significant_ premium to the DOC huts) for the days we wanted with [Ultimate Hikes](https://www.ultimatehikes.co.nz/), which is the only private guided walks operator with a permit to take hikers on the track. To be honest, this actually turned out great for us because they provided delicious food, hot showers and great lodging along the way. I'm not one for luxury and creature comforts when being out in the wild, but since it was our honeymoon, and we didn't really have another choice, I made my peace with it.

There were about fifty other people in our group, and the overall duration of the hike was five days, including transport from Queenstown and back. If you're interested, you can go to the Ultimate Hikes website to see the full [itinerary](https://www.ultimatehikes.co.nz/multi-day-guided-walks/milford-track/itinerary/). We hiked approximately 45 kilometers in total, and had to skip the last ten kilometers or so due to track closures as a result of some massive storms and flooding that had occurred a few weeks prior to our start date. Instead of walking this last part of the track, we actually got to ride on a helicopter over the valley to our final lodge in Milford Sound, which was awesome.

The hike itself was fairly straightforward and quite easy. My wife and I are both relatively fit, and we tend to do a fair amount of hiking when we are back home in Sydney around the Blue Mountains and Royal National Park. Of the four days of _actual_ hiking that we did, only one of them was what I would consider to be moderate difficulty. This was on the third day of the hike, when we went from Pompolana Lodge up over the MacKinnon Pass to Quintin Lodge. There was a steep uphill of zig-zags in the morning, which wasn't too bad, but the four hours or so of steep downhill in the afternoon was pretty taxing on our knees and quads.

Unfortunately, but not unexpectedly, we had bad weather at the top of the pass. It was cold, windy, and rainy, and we couldn't really see much of the valley on the other side of the pass due to the fact that we were basically inside a giant cloud waterfall rolling over the pass to the other side. We had lunch in a small but adequately heated hut on the top of the pass, and then continued the journey to Quintin Lodge down the valley on the other side of the pass. Once we got out of the clouds, the weather actually cleared up and we got to see quite a bit of the valley ahead, which was breathtaking.

We spent the majority of the hike walking through the dense and beautiful rainforest covering the valley floors, which were shaped and formed by massive glaciers over the course of millions of years. The flora here is mainly composed of large, thick trees, mostly silver and mountain beech, and dozens of varieties of ferns, shrubs and other smaller plants all competing with each other for sunlight. Most of the vegetation and forest floor is covered in thick layers of mosses and liverworts, which can be explained by the eight _meters_ of annual rainfall that the Fiordland receives. It felt like we were walking in Fangorn Forest from Middle Earth, as the atmosphere here definitely had some Tolkienesque vibes.

Another interesting curiosity about this area, and New Zealand in general, is the complete absence of large animals, or megafauna. It turns out that since the first Polynesian explorers, who eventually developed into the MƒÅori people, arrived in New Zealand about 800 years ago, all of the large animals in New Zealand have gone extinct or suffered major declines in population. I will let you draw your own conclusions from that fact, but pretty much all of the animals that we saw along the hike were birds, some small and some large, and some of them flightless. Perhaps the funniest of these was the _weka_, a rather large flightless bird which looks a little bit like an overgrown chicken. We saw these all over the huts that we ate and slept at, and they are curious creatures with a tendency to rumage through people's belongings looking for food.

Another incredible feature of the Milford Track is the sheer number of waterfalls that are visible everywhere. Because it rains for around two-hundred days of the year in the Fiordlands, waterfalls, both small and large, are constantly forming on the steep cliffs surrounding the valley. Furthermore, there is an abundance of smaller, but nevertheless stunning, waterfalls on the valley floor and inside the rainforest. This makes for some amazing vistas and great photo opportunities. But perhaps the most spectacular waterfall of all, and the highlight of the hike for me, was Sutherland Falls. At 580 metres, it is the second highest waterfall in New Zealand and one of the highest waterfalls in the world. We walked the short one-and-a-half-hour return trip to the falls after we arrived at Quintin Lodge, and even though we were tired, wet and cold from a long day of hiking, it was well worth it.

We managed to get very close to the base of the falls, and I even managed to scramble over a few mossy and very slippery rocks to get within a few metres of the giant boulder being pummeled by hundreds of litres of water a second. My wife and I both got very wet, but it was truly a sublime experience to bear witness to such beautiful and raw natural power. A little known fact about the Milford Track is that one of the original reasons for its development was so that walkers could go and visit Sutherland Falls. After visiting the falls ourselves, it became clear to us why Donald Sutherland wanted everyone to see this amazing place.

After a good night's sleep, we hiked the last seven kilometers or so of the track that wasn't closed due to flooding and landslides on the last day. Once we reached Boatshed, which was the last rest stop before the track closures began, we had a quick lunch and were then transported via helicopter to a small airfield right next to Milford Sound Lodge, which was our last overnight destination of the hike. Unfortunately, the weather on the day we arrived at Milford Sound, or Piopiotahi, wasn't great, but the views were spectacular nonetheless. However, the next morning, we were treated to some amazing views of the sheer rock faces of the fiord interlaced with some low lying clouds. This created a hauntingly beautiful effect that none of the pictures we took were able to truly capture, but you are just going to have to take my word for how incredible this place is even on a cold, cloudy day.

After a two-hour boat cruise into the depths of the fiord, we returned back to the lodge and took a four-hour bus trip back to Queenstown. At this point, we had also just connected to the internet after a wonderful five-day hiatus from constant information overload, and to be perfectly honest, I didn't really miss it all that much given the circumstances of our trip and us travelling right in the midst of the first _serious_ pandemic since 1918. In any case, it didn't feel like the world was in crisis in Queenstown, given that most of people there were tourists and nobody seemed to be following any of "social distancing" laws that would soon come into effect around the world.

## Relaxing in Queenstown

After our hike, we checked into our stunning Airbnb guest suite, which had stunning views of Lake Wakatipu. Although it was tempting to just buy a couple of bottles of wine, a lot of cheese and crackers, and sit on our porch soaking in the views for the rest of our trip, we had a few other fun experiences lined up.

One of the things we booked was an Airbnb experience for a microbrewery and winery tour, which turned out to be awesome. We got picked up by our host Jared, and he drove us to two different wineries and two microbreweries. We ended up getting pleasantly tipsy on a nice, sunny day, and I drunkenly spent too much money on a more than a few bottles of wine at the wineries. It was our first Airbnb experience and it was excellent, so we will definitely be doing a lot more of those in the future.

We also had a chance to explore Queenstown for a few days. We spent a morning indulging ourselves at the Onsen Hot Pools, where we spent a few hours in a hot tub and massages. We also had a fancy, over-the-top honeymoon dinner at Botswana Butchery, which was delicious and expensive, and explored the various lakeside parks and wharfs around the town. Then, we took a quick gondola trip up to the Skyline complex, which sits 450 metres above queenstown on the top of Bob's peak, and had some fun going doing the Queenstown Luge.
