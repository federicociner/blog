My wife and I got married about three weeks ago, on the cusp of the COVID-19 pandemic and right after one of the worst summers in Sydney's recorded history. After almost three months of devastating bushfires, followed by a few weeks of torrential rain and flooding, we got married among the vineyards of the Southern Highlands in beautifully mild and sunny weather. To say that we were extremely fortunate that our wedding plans, and the travel plans of more than half of our wedding guests flying in from overseas, were not impacted _any_ of these events is perhaps the understatement of the century.
