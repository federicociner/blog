So this marks the beginning of what will hopefully be a long-lived blog about, well, anything and everything really. After many years of reading technology, food, and travel blogs, I decided to take the plunge into content creation.

I noticed that a lot of bloggers tend to focus on very specific and often times niche subjects in their blogs, which is great if you already have a lot experience writing and publishing online content. For the time being, I'm going to let this blog evolve organically, which makes it easier for me since I can post about whatever I find interesting at that point in time. I also travel a lot and wanted to have a place I could post about my experiences and share with family and friends, as opposed to the mechanical and banal _"upload all photos from trip to **<insert photo sharing service here\>** and look at them once every few years."_

On another note, as a fairly inexperienced newcomer to the world of frontend development, here's a few things I learned today:

1. Static site generators are pretty cool. I spent the better part of my evenings over the last three weeks learning how to develop a static site **from scratch** and I barely made it past the rabbit hole that is CSS and styling. Today, I learned how to use React, Gatsby, Netlify, and a bunch of other super fancy, modern web frameworks I had never seen or read about before, and managed to set up _and_ publish what I believe is a clean and simple first attempt at a personal website. All in the span of a few hours.

1. Frontend development can be _really_ tedious. I now understand why most bloggers and online content creators tend to use batteries-included CMS platforms like WordPress. It takes a lot of time and effort to personalize fonts, customize CSS, pick colors and general styles, and format the various widgets on even a simple static site. And after finally deciding on _how_ the page will look, we still need to create some actual content! As a sofware engineer, I enjoy tinkering and learning how things work under the hood, but it makes perfect sense that most people will just say "f\*\*k this" and install WordPress.

1. There are way too many standards and frameworks in the frontend world. I understand that engineers are typically quite opinionated about how to build software, but it took me lots of research and reading to finally settle on which stack and tools I wanted to use to build this website. Even on [StaticGen](https://www.staticgen.com/), which maintains a list of the top static site generators, there are **281** different choices as of February 3, 2020! I think this _xkcd_ comic quite aptly summarizes the state of frontend development today (and to be honest, most other types of software development):

In any case, I'm quite happy with the results of my work thus far, and hopefully over the next few months will continue to make incremental improvements and additions to this website. My experience with React and Gatsby has been very smooth so far, and I am very grateful to the engineers who built these tools so that I don't have to spend eons creating external CSS and HTML from scratch.
