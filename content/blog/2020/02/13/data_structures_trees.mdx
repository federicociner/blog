## Introducing Trees

After having spent the last few blog posts going through arrays and linked lists, I am now going to spend a few post discussing and implementing tree structures. Trees are widely used in file systems, GUIs, databases, web sites and various other computer systems.

A **tree** is an abstract data type (ADT) that stores elements hierarchically. Each element in a tree has a _parent_ and zero or more _children_ elements. We can define a tree ${T}$ more formally as a set of _nodes_ storing nodes such that the nodes have a _parent-child_ relationship that satisfies the following properties:

- If ${T}$ is non-empty, it has a special node, called the _root_ of ${T}$, that has no parent.
- Each node ${v}$ of ${T}$ different from the root has a unique _parent_ node ${w}$; every node with parent ${w}$ is a _child_ of ${w}$.

Here are some other properties of trees and the relationships between nodes:

- Two nodes that are children of the same parent are _siblings_.
- A node ${v}$ is _external_ if ${v}$ has no children. These nodes are otherwise known as _leaves_.
- A node ${v}$ is _internal_ if it has one or more children.
- A node ${u}$ is an _ancestor_ of a node ${v}$ if ${u = v}$ or ${u}$ is ancestor of the parent of ${v}$; conversely, we say that a node ${v}$ is a _descendant_ of node ${u}$ if ${u}$ is an ancestor of ${v}$.
- The _subtree_ of ${T}$ _rooted_ at node ${v}$ is the tree consisting of all the descendants of ${v}$ in ${T}$.

### Edges and Paths in Trees

An _edge_ of tree ${T}$ is a pair of nodes $({u, v})$ such that ${u}$ is the parent of ${v}$, or vice versa. A _path_ of ${T}$ is a sequence of nodes such that any two consecutive nodes in the sequence form an edge.

### Ordered Trees

A tree is ordered if there is a meaningful linear order among the children of each node; that is, we identify the children of a node as being the first, second, third and so on. Such an order is usually visualised by arranging siblings left to right, according to their order.

## The Tree ADT

We will define a tree ADT using the concept of a _position_ as an abstraction for a node of a tree.
A position object supports the the following method:

- `p.element()`: Return the element stored at position ${p}$.

We can also think of the position element as a node in the tree. Furthermore, the tree ADT supports the following accessor methods:

- `T.root()`: Return the position of the root of tree ${T}$, or `None` if ${T}$ is empty.
- `T.is_root(p)`: Return `True` if position ${p}$ is the root of tree ${T}$.
- `T.parent(p)`: Return the position of the parent of position ${p}$, or `None` if ${p}$ is the root of ${T}$.
- `T.num_children(p)`: Return the number of children of position ${p}$.
- `T.children(p)`: Generates an iteration of the children of position ${p}$.
- `T.is_leaf(p)`: Return `True` if position ${p}$ does not have any children.
- `len(T)`: Return the number of positions that are contained in tree ${T}$.
- `T.is_empty()`: Return `True` if tree ${T}$ does not contain any positions.
- `T.positions()`: Generate an iteration of all _positions_ of tree ${T}$.
- `iter(T)`: Generate an iteration of all _elements_ stored within tree ${T}$.

We can use this tree ADT to define an abstract base class `Tree`, which we can use later on to implement concrete classes, such as a binary tree. Furthermore, since the `Tree` class is abstract, there is no reason to create a direct instance of it, since a lot of the methods will remain unimplemented until a concrete subclass uses these methods.

```python
class Tree:
    """Abstract base class representing a tree structure. """

    class Position:
        """An abstraction representing the location of a single element. """

        def element(self):
            """Return the element stored at this Position. """
            raise NotImplementedError("must be implemented by subclass")

        def __eq__(self, other):
            """Return True if other Position represents the same location. """
            raise NotImplementedError("must be implemented by subclass")

        def __ne__(self, other):
            """Return True if other does not represent the same location. """
            return not (self == other)

    def root(self):
        """Return Position representing the tree's root (or None if empty). """
        raise NotImplementedError("must be implemented by subclass")

    def parent(self, p):
        """Return Position representing p's parent (or None if p is root). """
        raise NotImplementedError("must be implemented by subclass")

    def num_children(self, p):
        """Return the number of children that Position p has. """
        raise NotImplementedError("must be implemented by subclass")

    def children(self, p):
        """Generate an iteration of Positions representing p's children. """
        raise NotImplementedError("must be implemented by subclass")

    def __len__(self):
        """Return the total number of elements in the tree. """
        raise NotImplementedError("must be implemented by subclass")

    def is_root(self, p):
        """Return True if Position p represents the root of the tree. """
        return self.root() == p

    def is_leaf(self, p):
        """Return True if Position p does not have any children. """
        return self.num_children(p) == 0

    def is_empty(self):
        """Return True if the tree is empty. """
        return len(self) == 0
```

### Computing Depth and Height

In addition to the abstract and concrete methods defined above, we will define two methods for computing the _depth_ and _height_ of a tree ${T}$. The depth of position ${p}$ is the number of ancestors of ${p}$, excluding ${p}$ itself.
