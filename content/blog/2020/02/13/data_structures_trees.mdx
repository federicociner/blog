## Introducing Trees

After having spent the last few blog posts going through arrays and linked lists, I am now going to spend a few post discussing and implementing tree structures. Trees are widely used in file systems, GUIs, databases, web sites and various other computer systems.

A **tree** is an abstract data type (ADT) that stores elements hierarchically. Each element in a tree has a _parent_ and zero or more _children_ elements. We can define a tree $T$ more formally as a set of _nodes_ storing nodes such that the nodes have a _parent-child_ relationship that satisfies the following properties:

- If $T$ is non-empty, it has a special node, called the _root_ of $T$, that has no parent.
- Each node $v$ of $T$ different from the root has a unique _parent_ node $w$; every node with parent $w$ is a _child_ of $w$.

Here are some other properties of trees and the relationships between nodes:

- Two nodes that are children of the same parent are _siblings_.
- A node $v$ is _external_ if $v$ has no children. These nodes are otherwise known as _leaves_.
- A node $v$ is _internal_ if it has one or more children.
- A node $u$ is an _ancestor_ of a node $v$ if $u = v$ or $u$ is ancestor of the parent of $v$; conversely, we say that a node $v$ is a _descendant_ of node $u$ if $u$ is an ancestor of $v$.
- The _subtree_ of $T$ _rooted_ at node $v$ is the tree consisting of all the descendants of $v$ in $T$.

### Edges and Paths in Trees

An _edge_ of tree $T$ is a pair of nodes $({u, v})$ such that $u$ is the parent of $v$, or vice versa. A _path_ of $T$ is a sequence of nodes such that any two consecutive nodes in the sequence form an edge.

### Ordered Trees

A tree is ordered if there is a meaningful linear order among the children of each node; that is, we identify the children of a node as being the first, second, third and so on. Such an order is usually visualised by arranging siblings left to right, according to their order.

## The Tree ADT

We will define a tree ADT using the concept of a _position_ as an abstraction for a node of a tree.
A position object supports the the following method:

- `p.element()`: Return the element stored at position $p$.

We can also think of the position element as a node in the tree. Furthermore, the tree ADT supports the following accessor methods:

- `T.root()`: Return the position of the root of tree $T$, or `None` if $T$ is empty.
- `T.is_root(p)`: Return `True` if position $p$ is the root of tree $T$.
- `T.parent(p)`: Return the position of the parent of position $p$, or `None` if $p$ is the root of $T$.
- `T.num_children(p)`: Return the number of children of position $p$.
- `T.children(p)`: Generates an iteration of the children of position $p$.
- `T.is_leaf(p)`: Return `True` if position $p$ does not have any children.
- `len(T)`: Return the number of positions that are contained in tree $T$.
- `T.is_empty()`: Return `True` if tree $T$ does not contain any positions.
- `T.positions()`: Generate an iteration of all _positions_ of tree $T$.
- `iter(T)`: Generate an iteration of all _elements_ stored within tree $T$.

We can use this tree ADT to define an abstract base class `Tree`, which we can use later on to implement concrete classes, such as a binary tree. Furthermore, since the `Tree` class is abstract, there is no reason to create a direct instance of it, since a lot of the methods will remain unimplemented until a concrete subclass uses these methods.

```python
class Tree:
    """Abstract base class representing a tree structure. """

    class Position:
        """An abstraction representing the location of a single element. """

        def element(self):
            """Return the element stored at this Position. """
            raise NotImplementedError("must be implemented by subclass")

        def __eq__(self, other):
            """Return True if other Position represents the same location. """
            raise NotImplementedError("must be implemented by subclass")

        def __ne__(self, other):
            """Return True if other does not represent the same location. """
            return not (self == other)

    def root(self):
        """Return Position representing the tree's root (or None if empty). """
        raise NotImplementedError("must be implemented by subclass")

    def parent(self, p):
        """Return Position representing p's parent (or None if p is root). """
        raise NotImplementedError("must be implemented by subclass")

    def num_children(self, p):
        """Return the number of children that Position p has. """
        raise NotImplementedError("must be implemented by subclass")

    def children(self, p):
        """Generate an iteration of Positions representing p's children. """
        raise NotImplementedError("must be implemented by subclass")

    def __len__(self):
        """Return the total number of elements in the tree. """
        raise NotImplementedError("must be implemented by subclass")

    def is_root(self, p):
        """Return True if Position p represents the root of the tree. """
        return self.root() == p

    def is_leaf(self, p):
        """Return True if Position p does not have any children. """
        return self.num_children(p) == 0

    def is_empty(self):
        """Return True if the tree is empty. """
        return len(self) == 0
```

### Computing Depth and Height

#### Depth

In addition to the abstract and concrete methods defined above, we will define two methods for computing the _depth_ and _height_ of a tree $T$. The depth of position $p$ is the number of ancestors of $p$, excluding $p$ itself. We can also define depth recursively as follows:

- If $p$ is the root, the depth of $p$ is 0.
- Otherwise, the depth of $p$ is one plus the depth of the parent of $p$.

We can use this definition to define a simple recursive algorithm to compute the depth of a position $p$ in a tree $T$:

```python
def depth(self, p):
    """Return the number of levels separating Position p from the root. """
    if self.is_root(p):
        return 0
    else:
        return 1 + self.depth(self.parent(p))
```

The worst-case running time of `T.depth(p)` for position $p$ is $O(n)$, where $n$ is the total number of positions of $T$, since a position of $T$ may have depth $n - 1$ if all nodes form a single branch.

#### Height

The height of a position $p$ in a tree $T$ can also be defined recursively:

- If $p$ is a leaf, then the height of $p$ is 0.
- Otherwise, the height of $p$ is one more than the maximum of the heights of $p$'s children.

The height of a non-empty tree $T$ is the height of the root of $T$. We can use a private helper method to recursively compute the height of a position $p$:

```python
def _height(self, p):
    """Return the height of the subtree rooted at Position p. """
    if self.is_leaf(p):
        return 0
    else:
        return 1 + max(self._height(c) for c in self.children(p))
```

Assuming that a concrete implementation of `children(p)` will run in $O(c_p + 1)$ time, where $c_p$ denotes the number of children of $p$, this algorithm will have a worst-case running time of $O(n)$. The algorithm spends $O(c_p + 1)$ time at each position $p$ to compute the maximum, and therefore its overall running time is $O(\sum_{p}(c_p + 1))$. To prove this, let $T$ be a tree with $n$ positions, and let $c_p$ denote the number of children of a position $p$ of $T$. Then, summing over the positions of $T$, $\sum_{p}c_p = n - 1$.

We can then use this private helper method to implemented a public `height` method, which allows a user to compute the height of an entire tree without explicitly designating the tree root as a parameter.

```python
def height(self, p = None):
    """Return the height of the subtree rooted at Position p.

    If p is None, return the height of the entire tree.

    """
    if p is None:
        p = self.root()

    return self._height(p)
```

## Summary

Now that we have our basic `Tree` abstract class and the appropriate helper methods to calculate the depth and height of the tree, we can now tackle some concrete implementations of tree-like data structures. In the next post of this series, I will discuss the binary tree and some tree traversal algorithms using binary trees.
