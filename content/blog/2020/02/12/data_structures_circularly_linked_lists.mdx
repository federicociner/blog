## Circularly Linked Lists: A Primer

Having introduced the concept of a circular array in my [post](../../10/data_structures_queues) describing how to implement queues and deques, we can also have a notion of _circularly linked lists_. In this case, we can have the tail of the list use its next reference to point back to the head of the list.

A circularly linked list provides a more general model than a standard linked list for datasets that are cyclic, that is, which do not have any particular notion of a beginning and end. Even though a circularly linked list has no beginning or end, we have to maintain a reference to a particular node in order to make use of the list. We can use the identifier **current** to describe such a node; by setting `current = current.next` we can effectively advance through nodes of the list.

## Round-Robin Schedulers

We can use circularly linked lists to implement a **round-robin** scheduler, which iterates through a collection of elements in a circular fashion and "services" each element by performing a given action on it. These types of schedulers are typically used to fairly allocate resources that must be shared by a collection of clients, for example allocating slices of CPU time to various applications running concurrently on a computer.

We could implement a round-robin scheduler using the general queue ADT by repeatedly performing the following steps on queue `Q`:

1. `e = Q.dequeue(e)`
2. Service element `e`
3. `Q.enqueue(e)`

If we are using the `LinkedQueue` class from my previous post, there is unnecessary effort in the combination of a `dequeue` operation followed soon after by an `enqueue` of the same element. If we use a circularly linked list, we can accomplish the transfer of an item from the "head" of the list to the "tail" of the list by advancing a reference that marks the boundary of the list. With this operation, a round-robin scheduler can more efficiently be implemented by repeatedly performing the following steps:

1. Service element `Q.front()`
2. `Q.rotate()`

With this in mind, we can implement a `CircularQueue` class that supports the entire queue ADT, but adds an additional method `rotate`, which moves the first element of the queue to the back. This class has the following characteristics:

- The only two instance variables in this class are `_tail`, which is a reference to the tail node, and `_size`, which is the current number of elements in the queue.
- When an operation involves the front of the queue, we recognise `self._tail._next` as the head of the queue.
- When `enqueue` is called, a new node is placed just after the tail but before the current head, and then the new node becomes the tail.

```python
class CircularQueue:
    """Queue implementation using circularly linked list for storage. """

    class _Node:
        """Lightweight private class for storing a singly linked node. """

        __slots__ = "_element", "_next"

        def __init__(self, element, next):
            self._element = element
            self._next = next

    def __init__(self):
        """Create an empty queue. """
        self._tail = None
        self._size = 0

    def __len__(self):
        """Return the number of elements in the queue. """
        return self._size

    def __str__(self):
        """Print contents of the circular queue, staring at the head. """
        curr = self._tail._next
        res = ""

        for i in range(self._size):
            if i != self._size - 1:
                res += f"Node{{element: {curr._element}}} -> "
            else:
                res += f"Node{{element: {curr._element}}}"

            curr = curr._next

        return res

    def is_empty(self):
        """Return True if the queue is empty. """
        return self._size == 0

    def first(self):
        """Return (but do not remove) the element at the front of the queue.

        """
        if self.is_empty():
            raise Empty("Queue is empty.")

        head = self._tail._next

        return head._element

    def dequeue(self):
        """Remove and return the first element of the queue (i.e. FIFO). """
        if self.is_empty():
            raise Empty("Queue is empty.")

        oldhead = self._tail._next
        if self._size == 1:
            self._tail = None
        else:
            self._tail._next = oldhead._next
        self._size -= 1

        return oldhead._element

    def enqueue(self, e):
        """Add an element to the back of the queue. """
        newest = self._Node(e, None)

        if self.is_empty():
            newest._next = newest
        else:
            newest._next = self._tail._next
            self._tail._next = newest

        self._tail = newest
        self._size += 1

    def rotate(self):
        """Rotate front element to the back of the queue. """
        if self._size > 0:
            self._tail = self._tail._next
```

We can see some example `enqueue` and `dequeue` operations below. For convenience, I've added a `__str__` method to print out the current queue in a human-readable format. You can also download a sample Python source code file of this code [here](sample_circularly_linked_lists.py).

```python
>>> S = CircularQueue()
>>> S.enqueue(1)
>>> S.enqueue(2)
>>> S.enqueue(3)
>>> S.enqueue(4)
>>> print(S)
Node{element: 1} -> Node{element: 2} -> Node{element: 3} -> Node{element: 4}
>>> S.dequeue()
>>> print(S.first())
2
>>> S.enqueue(7)
>>> print(S)
Node{element: 2} -> Node{element: 3} -> Node{element: 4} -> Node{element: 7}
>>> S.rotate()
>>> print(S)
Node{element: 3} -> Node{element: 4} -> Node{element: 7} -> Node{element: 2}
```

As before, the `CircularQueue` is similar to the `LinkedQueue` in that all operations run in worst-case $O(1)$ time, and the space usage is $O({n})$ in the number of elements.
