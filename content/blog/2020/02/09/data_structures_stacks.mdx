## Stacks: A Primer

A stack is a collection of objects that are inserted and removed according to the "last-in, first-out" (LIFO) principle. Stacks are one of the simplest data structures, but also one of the most important. They are used in a variety of different applications, and also as scaffolding for more sophisticated data structures and algorithms.

A stack is an abstract data type (ADT) such that an instance `S` supports the following two methods:

- `S.push(e)`: Adds an element ${e}$ to the collection.
- `S.pop()`: Removes the most recently added element that was not yet removed. If the stack is empty, an error occurs.

We can define some additional accessor methods for convenience:

- `S.top()`: Returns a reference to the top element of stack `S` without removing it.
- `S.is_empty()`: Return `True` if stack `S` does not contain any elements.
- `len(S)`: Returns the number of elements in stack `S`.

## Implementing an Array-based Stack

We can implement a stack by storing its elements in a Python list. However, the `list` class includes additional operations, such as adding or removing elements from arbitrary positions, that would break the abstraction that the stack ADT represents.

We will be using the _adapter_ design pattern to create our stack data structure, which allows the interface of an existing class (in this case the Python `list`) to be used as another interface. We will adapt the `list` class using the correspondences in the table below:

| Stack Method   | Corresponding `list` method |
| -------------- | --------------------------- |
| `S.push(e)`    | `L.append(e)`               |
| `S.pop()`      | `L.pop()`                   |
| `S.top()`      | `L[-1]`                     |
| `S.is_empty()` | `len(L) == 0`               |
| `len(S)`       | `len(L)`                    |

We also need to define a new exception class to use when a user calls `pop` or `top` on an empty stack. In an empty `list`, calling `pop` would throw an `IndexError` but this isn't appropriate for a stack, since there is no assumption of indices. We will call this exception class `Empty`:

```python
class Empty(Exception):
    """Error attempting to access an element from an empty container. """
    pass
```

Now, we can define an `ArrayStack` class that uses an underlying Python `list` for storage.

```python
class ArrayStack:
    """LIFO stack implementation using a Python list as underlying storage. """

    def __init__(self):
        """Create an empty stack. """
        self._data = []

    def __len__(self):
        """Return the number of elements in the stack. """
        return len(self._data)

    def is_empty(self):
        """Return True if the stack is empty. """
        return len(self._data) == 0

    def push(self, e):
        """Add element e to the top of the stack. """
        self._data.append(e)

    def top(self):
        """Return (but do not remove) the element at the top of the stack. """
        if self.is_empty():
            raise Empty("Stack is empty")

        return self._data[-1]

    def pop(self):
        """Remove and return the element from the top of the stack
        (i.e. LIFO). """
        if self.is_empty():
            raise Empty("Stack is empty")
        return self._data.pop()
```

Here's a simple demonstration of using the `ArrayStack` by pushing two elements to the stack, and subsequently popping them from the stack.

```python
>>> S = ArrayStack()
>>> S.push(5)
>>> S.push(3)
>>> print(len(S))
2
>>> print(S.pop())
3
>>> print(S.is_empty())
False
>>> print(S.pop())
5
>>> print(S.is_empty())
True
```

You can download a sample Python source code file of the implementation and examples above [here](sample_stack.py).

## Asymptotic Analysis of the Array-based Stack

The table below shows the running time for the `ArrayStack` methods.

| Operation      | Running Time (\*amortised) |
| -------------- | -------------------------- |
| `S.push(e)`    | $O(1)$\*                   |
| `S.pop()`      | $O(1)$\*                   |
| `S.top()`      | $O(1)$                     |
| `S.is_empty()` | $O(1)$                     |
| `len(S)`       | $O(1)$                     |

The $O(1)$ time for `push` and `pop` are amortised bounds; a typical call to either of these methods uses constant time, but there is occasionally an $O({n})$-time worst case, where $n$ is the current number of elements in the stack, when an operation causes the list to resize its internal array. The space usage for a stack is $O({n})$.
