So this marks the beginning of what will hopefully be a long-lived blog about, well, anything and everything really. After many years of reading technology, food, and travel blogs, I decided to take the plunge into content creation.

I noticed that a lot of bloggers tend to focus on very specific and often times niche subjects in their blogs, which is great if you already have a lot experience writing and publishing online content. For the time being, I'm going to let this blog evolve organically, which makes it easier for me since I can post about whatever I find interesting at that point in time. I also travel a lot and wanted to have a place I could post about my experiences and share with family and friends, as opposed to the mechanical and banal _"upload all photos from trip to __<insert photo sharing service here\>__ and look at them once every few years."_

On another note, as a fairly inexperienced newcomer to the world of frontend development, here's a few things I learned today:

1. Static site generators are _amazing_. I spent the better part of my evenings over the last three weeks learning how to develop a static site __from scratch__ and I barely made it past the rabbit hole that is CSS and styling.

    Today, I learned how to use React, Gatsby, Netlify, and a bunch of other super fancy, modern web frameworks I had never seen or read about before, and managed to set up _and_ publish what I believe is a clean and simple first attempt at a personal website. All in the span of a few hours.

1. Frontend development can be _very_ tedious. I now understand why most bloggers and online content creators tend to use batteries-included CMS platforms like WordPress. It takes a lot of time and effort to personalize fonts, customize CSS, pick colors and general styles, and format the various widgets on even a simple static site. And after finally deciding on _how_ the page will look, we still need to create some actual content! As a sofware engineer, I enjoy tinkering and learning how things work under the hood, but it makes perfect sense that most people will just say "f**k this" and install WordPress.
