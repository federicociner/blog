So this marks the beginning of what will hopefully be a long-lived blog about, well, anything and everything really. After many years of reading technology, food, and travel blogs, I decided to take the plunge into content creation.

I noticed that a lot of bloggers tend to focus on specific subjects in their posts, which is great if you already have experience writing and publishing online content. For the time being, I'm going to let this blog evolve organically, which makes it easier for me since I can post about whatever I find interesting at that point in time. I also travel a lot and wanted to have a place I could post about my experiences and share with family and friends, as opposed to the mechanical and banal _"upload all photos from trip to __<insert photo sharing service here\>__ and look at them once every few years."_

As a fairly inexperienced newcomer to the world of frontend development, here's a few things I learned:

1. Static site generators are _amazing_. I spent the better part of my evenings over the last three weeks learning how to develop a static site __from scratch__ and I barely made it past the rabbit hole that is CSS and styling.

    Today, I learned how to use React, Gatsby, Netlify, and a bunch of other super fancy, modern web frameworks I had never seen or read about before, and managed to set up what I believe is a clean and simple first attempt at a personal website. All in the span of a few hours.

1. Frontend development can be _very_ tedious. I now understand why most bloggers and online content creators tend to use batteries-included CMS platforms like WordPress.
