My wife and I got married about three weeks ago, on the cusp of the COVID-19 pandemic and right after one of the worst summers in Sydney's recorded history. After almost three months of devastating bushfires, followed by a few weeks of torrential rain and flooding, we got married among the vineyards of the Southern Highlands in beautifully mild and sunny weather. To say that we were extremely fortunate that our wedding plans, and the travel plans of more than half of our wedding guests flying in from overseas, were not impacted _any_ of these events is perhaps the understatement of the century.

In any case, everything turned out wonderfully and we had an amazing wedding day with all of our friends from across the world joining us to celebrate. For our honeymoon, we kind of decided last minute (well, I did since I was the one that planned it) that we wanted to go somewhere wild and far, far away from crowds and people in general. So, a multi-day hike in New Zealand's beautiful south island and a couple of days of adventuring in Queenstown ticked all the right boxes.

## The Milford Track

We decided to hike the world-famous Milford Track for the first part of our honeymoon. Since we left bookings until the last minute due to wedding planning craziness and my limitless procrastination, I wasn't able to get any spots for my wife and I in the Department of Conservation (DOC) huts along the track. However, we managed to book the last two spots (for a _significant_ premium) for the days we wanted with [Ultimate Hikes](https://www.ultimatehikes.co.nz/), which is the only private guided walks company that is allowed to take hikers on the Milford Track. To be honest, this actually turned out quite well because they provided delicious food and lodging along the way, with hot showers as well!
